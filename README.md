## Useful filesystem commands

**Note** Always try to use tab whenever possible, it saves on spelling errors and helps you move faster

- `cd`: change directory
  - `cd ~` will put you into your home directory
  - `cd /some/file/path/to/some/directory` will put you in to the folder path you described
- `ls`: list directory contents
  - `ls -a` lists all contents *including* hidden files
  - `ls -l` lists all files and shows information about them such as modified date and size
  - `ls /` will show "normal" files in your root directory
  - combining all of these you could show all files in the root, and the data about them using `ls -la /`
- `cp`: copy
  - `cp -r /source/directory/name/ /destination/directory/` will copy the content of source to destination
  - `cp file_1 new_file` will make a copy of *file_1* named *new_file*
